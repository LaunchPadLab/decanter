# v4.0.0 Migration Guide

_Note: this guide assumes you are upgrading from decanter v3 to v4._

This version contains the following breaking changes:

1. `FloatParser` and `IntegerParser` have been updated to address a bug where negative numbers were being parsed as positive. In the (unlikely) event that your project was relying on the previous behavior, you can include the legacy version(s) of the parsers as custom parsers in your project. Their source code is available on the `v3` branch.
